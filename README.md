## Algorithm Timer

A tool to test the length of time it takes for an algorithm to finish executing.
Intended help someone (and me) learn about algorithm efficiency and complexity through interaction.

### To run the code

Copy the path for base.html and in the developer console run:

```
let timer = new AlgorithmTimer();
let array = [x,y,z];
let function = 'nameOfFunctionYoudLikeToTest'
timer.recordTime(array, function);
```
